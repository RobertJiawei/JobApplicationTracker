# Job Application Tracker

---

## This project aims to help me keep track of my job applications. With the number of applications submitted, it's easy to lose track of the companies or positions applied to. The project enables me to add job applications to a database, providing a structured overview of all my applications. Additionally, it offers the ability to search by company name and sort by company name, position, and applied date. To manage these features, I developed a REST API running at backend

### This project also help me practice with React.js, Node.js an MongoDB, familiarized myself with React Hooks(State/Effect), Async/Await, JSX, Components, Props, CSS, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, Axios
